mars rover kata


data
    grid size
    no. of rovers
    rover positions

behaviour
    move
    turn left, right


Grid
    int length
    int breadth
    list<Rover>
    IsRoverInValidPositionToMove(rover) -> bool
    AddRover(Rover) -> grid w/o rovers means nothing in this context. so move this to ctor
    MoverRover(rover)
    GetRoverPosition(rover) -> Position
    TurnRover(rover, direction) -> conceptually, grid contains rovers so, exposing all public APIs through grid makes sense. this way, client doesnt have to know about rover's behaviour.

Rover
    Position
    void Turn(direction)
    void Move() 
         -> needs to check if the move is valid
         -> if we do this by calling the containing class grid's IsValid method, then move takes implicit dependency on grid
         -> instead, we can expose the Move API in Grid and pass the rover as a parameter. this way client code can call grid.Move(rover) and so it's clear that both rover and grid are involved in the move operation
    GetPosition() -> Position => using public getters and private setters

Position
    int x
    int y
    char direction




tests
 - L shud turn left
 - R shud turn right
 - move shud move 1 point
 - out of bounds check
 - get position shud return correct position
 - shudnt move a rover that is not in the grid
 - sequence of steps
